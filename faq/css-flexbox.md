### Flexbox Alignment with `alignItems="flex-start"`
*Added: 2025-10-08*

**Question:** Why use `alignItems="flex-start"` when laying out ShapeSelector and TransformPanel side-by-side?

**Thinking:**
When placing two components side-by-side with Flexbox, you need to decide how they align vertically. The ShapeSelector and TransformPanel have different content amounts and therefore different natural heights. Without explicit alignment control, Flexbox's default behavior (`stretch`) would force both components to match the height of the taller one, creating awkward empty space in the shorter component.

**Explanation:**

Flexbox has two axes:
- **Main axis**: The direction items flow (horizontal for `flex-direction: row`, vertical for `flex-direction: column`)
- **Cross axis**: Perpendicular to the main axis (vertical for row, horizontal for column)

Key properties:
1. **`justifyContent`** - Controls alignment along the **main axis**
2. **`alignItems`** - Controls alignment along the **cross axis**

For `alignItems` values:
- `stretch` (default) - Items stretch to fill the container's cross-axis dimension
- `flex-start` - Items align to the start of the cross axis (top for row layout)
- `flex-end` - Items align to the end of the cross axis (bottom for row layout)
- `center` - Items center along the cross axis
- `baseline` - Items align based on their text baseline

**Example:**

```jsx
// ‚ùå Default behavior (stretch)
<Flex gap={6}>
  <Box flex="1">
    <ShapeSelector />  {/* 200px tall */}
  </Box>
  <Box flex="1">
    <TransformPanel /> {/* 400px tall */}
  </Box>
</Flex>
// Result: ShapeSelector stretches to 400px, creating empty space

// ‚úÖ With alignItems="flex-start"
<Flex gap={6} alignItems="flex-start">
  <Box flex="1">
    <ShapeSelector />  {/* Stays 200px tall */}
  </Box>
  <Box flex="1">
    <TransformPanel /> {/* Stays 400px tall */}
  </Box>
</Flex>
// Result: Both maintain natural heights, aligned at top
```

**Additional concepts used:**

1. **`flex="1"`** on child boxes:
   - Shorthand for `flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1, flex-basis: 0`
   - Makes both children take equal space (50/50 split)
   - They grow to fill available space equally

2. **`gap={6}`**:
   - Modern CSS gap property (replaces margin-based spacing)
   - Creates consistent spacing between flex children
   - No margin collapsing issues

**Impact:**

Understanding Flexbox alignment is crucial for building responsive layouts:
- **Performance**: Flexbox is optimized by browsers for layout calculations
- **Maintainability**: Clear alignment rules make layouts predictable
- **Responsiveness**: Flexbox adapts to content size changes automatically
- **Accessibility**: Natural document flow improves screen reader navigation

In this specific case:
- ShapeSelector appears first, takes up space naturally
- TransformPanel appears conditionally without shifting other elements
- Both maintain visual hierarchy without artificial sizing
- Layout feels natural as content appears/disappears
