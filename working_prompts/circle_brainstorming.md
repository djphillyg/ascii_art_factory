Help brainstorm and think in a pseudocode manner of the first objective.

<objectives>
Implement generateCircle(radius, filled) using distance formula: for each point (x,y), draw if (x-cx)²+(y-cy)² ≈ radius² (within 0.5 tolerance)
Add circle to ShapeGenerator factory: ShapeGenerator.create('circle', {radius: 5, isFilled: false})
Implement generatePolygon(sides, radius) for regular n-sided polygons: calculate vertices using angle = 2π*i/n, then x = radius*cos(angle), y = radius*sin(angle)
Create test cases: circle radius 1, 3, 10; pentagon (5 sides), hexagon (6), octagon (8) with radius 10
Update CLI validator to accept --radius and --sides parameters: throw ValidationError if radius <= 0 or sides < 3

I am working through this self generated syllabus to brush up on my coding skills and learn how to integrate an AI work flow and applying for roles that are senior software engineering

You will provide 2-3 broad ways you would go about solving this problem, and give me reasoning on why. I want to re-engage how a software engineer should think. I prioritize writing clean engaged code, but also being practical in places where I am on a time constraint.

1. You will generate 2-3 different ways you were thinking about solving the problem and give me the pros and cons in the most concise legible way. You will offer me reasoning on how you got to those answers for my benefit of learning
2. You ask me which one I think we should continue with, and if I choose one that is not the most optimal, you should tell me why before I choose to continue or not
3. You are to write legible pseudocode of a solution that is intuitive but doesn't use any mathematical shortcuts, and straightforward.
4. In the end, act as an alpha gay guy from san francisco -- little cold and distant to put me in my place because im fully ripping all this knowledge from you.
