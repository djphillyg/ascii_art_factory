<code>
This ASCII art generator can draw rectangles, circles and polygons with certain sizes and also output to files
</code>

<first_iteration>
my goal is to have a full react project with set ups in all reducers, redux
scss files, build scripts what have you, and go on the website and basically be able to choose which shape you wanna draw and plug in the size and it shows up in some element
</first_iteration>

<objectives>
- Soak up fundamental diverse skills across the project to re-ingest react and catch up on practices and fundamentals. I want strict patterning enforced for learning how to be concise and simple
- Having some tasks dedicated to one or two days of what's left on the command line generator syllabus
- Move the projects scope beyond the ascii art generator and plug into APIs, maybe claude's itself to learn how to generate images but use a front end, enhancing my deep knowledge of claude and something to present to recruiters as something i've learned how to do
</objectives>

<syllabus>
I've been using this syllabus format I have given claude to help me iterate on the project itself 
Please refer to days 3 and 4, they have been completed, and also one of the days where you generate a number or more art ones and less math, in the end I want to generate a 11 day syllabus (we will count today as day 0 because we will start tomorrow) that will look and feel like the one i am sending now but with the new focused objectives

</syllabus>

## THEME: 🎪 CIRCUS SPECTACULAR (Day 4 - Completion)
*Finishing the fundamentals with flair*

### DAY 4: The Acrobat's Perfect Landing
**MOTIVATIONAL QUOTE:** *"Completion is not about perfection, but about honoring the journey and claiming your progress."* - Jack Kornfield

**OBJECTIVES:**
1. Implement `--output filename.txt` flag that writes ASCII art to file using `fs.writeFileSync()`
2. Add file system error handling: wrap in try/catch, handle EACCES (permission denied), ENOSPC (no space), EISDIR (is directory)
3. Create test case: `node index.js draw --shape rectangle --width 5 --height 3 --output test.txt` then verify file contents match expected
4. Add `--append` flag that appends to file instead of overwriting using `fs.appendFileSync()`
5. Build `shapes.test.js` unit tests: test `generateRectangle({width: 3, height: 3, isFilled: false})` returns correct 2D array

**MOTIVATIONAL QUOTE:** *"In recursion, we see the universe's favorite pattern: the whole reflected in each part."* - Jack Kornfield

**OBJECTIVES:**

2. Create Koch snowflake: start with equilateral triangle, each iteration adds smaller triangles to middle third of each line segment
3. Implement fractal tree: recursive binary tree where each branch splits at angle θ, with depth parameter
4. Add `--iterations` parameter to CLI: validate iterations >= 0 and iterations <= 8 (prevent stack overflow)

**OBJECTIVES:**
1. Implement Mandelbrot set renderer: for each point (x,y) in grid, iterate `z = z² + c` and count iterations until |z| > 2
2. Map iteration count to ASCII characters: use density string ` .:-=+*#%@` where ' ' = quick escape, '@' = slow escape (in set)
3. Add `--zoom` and `--center` parameters: allow zooming into interesting regions like (-0.5, 0)
4. Implement Julia set: similar to Mandelbrot but use fixed c value, vary starting z - add `--julia` flag with c parameter

**MOTIVATIONAL QUOTE:** *"True mastery comes when separate skills unite into something greater than their sum."* - Jack Kornfield

**OBJECTIVES:**
1. Implement layering system: `compositeShapes(shape1, shape2, mode)` where mode = 'overlay'|'add'|'subtract' - overlay places shape2 on top of shape1
2. Add transformation functions: `translateShape(shape, dx, dy)`, `scaleShape(shape, factor)` using matrix operations
3. Create scene compositions: implement `--scene` option that creates predefined compositions like 'house' (rectangle + triangle roof), 'snowman' (3 circles stacked)
